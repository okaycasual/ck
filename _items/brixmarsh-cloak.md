This night-blue cloak of crushed blue velvet bears silver runes on the hum, and on the right shoulder, a heraldic rendering of two towers-- the symbol of Brixmarsh, a failed school of magic foolishly built on the outskirts of the Flooded Forest. These cloaks were originally created for that school, in ambitious nubmers far higher than its eventual enrollment, but are now issued by the Avoewed to apprentices studying under masters of the Art.



***Protected Pocket.*** The cloak has a pocket that magically stretches to hold a single book weighing 7 pounds of less. While in the pocket, a book is protected from all moisture and its weight is reduced to one-tenth of normal, though its shape can be clearly seen buling through the outside of the cloak. For 1 hour after a book is removed from the pocket, its pages shed a faint pale-blue light just enough to read it by.
