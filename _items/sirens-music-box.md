This music box appears to have a petrified fairy fixed atop it and is well-worn. 

***Enchanting Tune.*** When the music box is open it plays a haunting tune, up to 4 creatures within hearing range must make a Wisdom saving throw or be lured toward the box whilst it remains open. The music does not effect the one who opens the box. If the creatures are in combat they may must make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of every round.

Once they succeed a saving throw or their concentration is broken, the music stops having any effect.
