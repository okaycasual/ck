This gold amulet incases a large dark red garnet, fitting for any fancy royal court.  

***Deep Deep Red.*** Touching the amulet whilst a creature opposite the wearer stairs into it will cast the sleep spell, but the target creature can make a WIS saving throw to avoid falling asleep.

This item may only be used once per long rest, even if unsuccessful.
