***Create Sweet Treat.*** Touching the ring the wearer can imagine any sweet treat no larger than a cake or smaller than a boiled sweet and it will appear after a few seconds in front of them. They may also choose to conjure up to 5 identical versions of the treat.

When in range, unless a creature is adverse to sweet things or a particular food they will be drawn to the treat and take an interest in it.
