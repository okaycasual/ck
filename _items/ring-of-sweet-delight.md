This pink gold ring is thicker on the finger than might usually be epxected

***Create Sweet Treat.*** Touching the ring the wearer can imagine any sweet treat no larger than a cake or smaller than a boiled sweet and it will appear after a few seconds in front of them.

When in range, unless a creature is adverse to sweet things or a particular food they will be drawn to the treat and take an interest in it.

If they consume the entire treat the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed, following the effects of Charm Person spell, except that the create does not know they have been charmed, and may return to you for more treats.e

This can only be used once per long rest.
