***Avoidance.*** If the displacer cub is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Minor Displacement.*** The displacer cub creates a static illusory copy of a Medium or smaller object it can see within 60 feet The illusion persists until the start of the cubâ€™s next turn. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion.

### Actions
